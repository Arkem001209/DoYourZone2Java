Hi there! Welcome to my fitness app project, "Do Your Zone 2"!

If like me you are an amateur endurance athlete you also know that zone 2 aerobic training can often be the bain of our existence. We know how good it is for us yet we still
refuse to stick to our heart rate zones. This often results in high heart rate, inefficient training, insufficient results and further frustration!

Ive noticed that with all the modern fitness apps out there, there isnt too much that helps with this common problem. Its my intension to build an app that helps to make this
long monotonous traing a smidge more enjoyable. The app in its most basic form works in the terminal. Once I have created a proper interface and login server I shall detail
the setup instructions here.

Thanks!
